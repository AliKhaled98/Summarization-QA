 Jörg Schmadtke has been one of the Bundesliga’s most successful operators
 over the last decade or so – provided one is prepared to look beyond
 silverware and positions in the table. Since first getting appointed in his role
 at second division Alemannia Aachen in 2001, the former Borussia
 Mönchengladbach goalkeeper has never seen one of his teams win the
 championship or the DFB Pokal German Cup. His work has nevertheless
 been extraordinary, as he’s routinely overachieved everywhere.
 He led heavily indebted Aachen not only into the UEFA Cup/Europa
 League, courtesy of reaching the domestic cup final, but also saw them
 promoted to the top flight for the first time in 30 years in 2007. During his
reign at Hannover 96 (2009–13), the Lower Saxons twice qualified for
 Europe and played their best-ever season in the Bundesliga. And in 2017,
 Schmadtke managed to guide 1. FC Köln, one of Germany’s most storied
 but also most temperamental clubs, into the Europa League after a 25-year
 absence.
 There are many different definitions of a sporting director’s role in the
 Bundesliga. For Schmadtke, the scouting of players has always been a key
 part of his work. Often, he effectively served as the chief scout and
 travelled the world in search of new recruits, picking up a high number of
 very good strikers along the way. Without spelling it out explicitly himself,
 Schmadtke has had to deal with one of scouting’s biggest problems – the
 propensity for systematic errors in judgement. Or, as psychologists call it:
 cognitive bias.
